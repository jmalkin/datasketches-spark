# Apache<sup>&reg;</sup> DataSketches&trade; Spark Library

This repo is still an early-stage work in progress.

There have been multiple attempts to help integrate Apache DataSketches into Apache Spark, including one built into Spark itself as of v3.5. All are useful work, but in comparing them, there are various limitations to each library. Whether limitng the type of sketches available (e.g. native Spark provides only HLL) or limiting flexibility and functionality (e.g. forcing HLL and Theta to use a common interface which precludes set operations HLL cannot support, or using global parameters to control the sizes of all sketch instances in the query), the other libraries place undesirable constraints on developers looking to use sketches in their queries or data systems. This library aims to restore that choice to develoeprs.
